EVENT mefSoamAvailabilityChangeAlarm .1.3.6.1.4.1.15007.1.3.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT An mefSoamAvailabilityChangeAlarm notification is sent when the state of $*

An mefSoamAvailabilityChangeAlarm notification is sent when the state of
mefSoamLmMeasuredStatsAvailForwardStatus or 
mefSoamLmMeasuredStatsAvailBackwardStatus changes. 
The management entity that receives the notification can identify
the system from the network source address of the notification,
and can identify the PM session reporting the change
by the indices in the OID 
mefSoamLmMeasuredStatsAvailForwardLastTransitionTime, including
dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier, and 
mefSoamLmCfgIndex.
An agent is not to generate more than one mefSoamAvailabilityChangeAlarm
'notification-event' in a given time interval per PM session as 
specified by the mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval.  A 
'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification to
a list of notification destinations.
If additional availability state changes occur within the 
mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval period, then notification 
generation for these changes are suppressed by the agent until 
the current alarm interval expires. At the end of an alarm interval 
period, one notification-event is generated if any availability
state changes occurred since the start of the alarm interval period. 
In such a case, another alarm interval period is started right away.

An mefSoamLmSessionStartStopAlarm notification is sent when the state of
mefSoamLmCfgSessionStatus changes. 
The management entity that receives the notification can identify
the system from the network source address of the notification,
and can identify the individual PM session reporting the start/stop
by the indices in the OID mefSoamLmCfgSessionStatus, including
dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier, and 
mefSoamLmCfgIndex.
An agent is not to generate more than one mefSoamLmSessionStartStopAlarm
'notification-event' in a given time interval per LM session as specified
by the mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval.  A 'notification-event' is
the transmission of a single notification to a list of notification 
destinations.
If additional operational state changes occur within the 
mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval period, then notification 
generation for these changes are be suppressed by the agent until 
the current alarm interval expires. At the end of an alarm interval 
period, one notification-event is generated if any operational 
state changes occurred since the start of the alarm interval period. In
such a case, another alarm interval period is started right away.

EVENT mefSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm .1.3.6.1.4.1.15007.1.3.0.4 "Status Events" Normal

An mefSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm notification is sent if the 
following conditions are met for a particular type.
For an aboveAlarm five conditions need to be met:
a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
for a LM crossing or mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing; 
and
b) the parameter threshold is configured in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
or mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and 
c) the threshold crossing type of bPmThresholdAboveAlarm is enabled; 
and
d) the measured value of the parameter exceeds the value configured in
the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for a LM crossing entry or
mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing entry for a type of
bPmThresholdAboveAlarm; and
e) no previous mefSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm notifications with type
aboveAlarm have been sent relating to the same threshold in the
mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable or mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable and the
same parameter, during this Measurement Interval.
For a setAlarm five conditions need to be met:
a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
for a LM crossing or mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing; 
and
b) the parameter threshold is configured in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
or mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and 
c) the threshold crossing type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm is enabled; 
and
d) the measured value of the parameter exceeds the value configured in
the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for a LM crossing entry or
mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing entry for a type of
bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm for the Measurement Interval; and
e) the previous measured value did not 
exceed the value configured in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for
a LM crossing entry or mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing
entry for a type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm.
For a clearAlarm five conditions need to be met:
a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via mefSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
for a LM crossing or mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing; 
and
b) the parameter threshold is configured in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
or mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and 
c) the threshold crossing type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm is enabled; 
and
d) the measured value of the parameter did not exceed the value configured 
in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for a LM crossing entry or
mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing entry for a type of
bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm for the Measurement Interval; and
e) the previous measured value did  
exceed the value configured in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for
a LM crossing entry or mefSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing
entry for a type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm.
In the case of thresholds applied to a maximum or average measurement
counter, the previous measured value is the value of the counter at the
end of the preceding Measurement Interval.  In the case of thresholds
applied to the last measured value, it is the previous measured value.
The management entity that receives the notification can identify
the system from the network source address of the notification,
and can identify the LM or DM session reporting the threshold
crossing by the indices in the mefSoamPmNotificationCfgThresholdId object,
including dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier, 
and the mefSoamLmCfgIndex or mefSoamDmCfgIndex. 
An agent is not to generate more than one mefSoamLmThresholdCrossingAlarm
'notification-event' of a given type per LM or DM session as specified
by mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval. A 'notification-event' is the
transmission of a single notification to a list of notification
destinations.
If additional threshold crossing events occur within the 
mefSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval period, then notification 
generation for these changes are suppressed by the agent until 
the current alarm interval expires. At the end of an alarm interval 
period, one notification-event is generated if any threshold
crossing events occurred since the start of the alarm interval period. 
In such a case, another alarm interval period is started right away.
