An ospfIfStateChange trap signifies that there
has been a change in the state of a non-virtual
OSPF interface. This trap should  be  generated
when  the interface state regresses (e.g., goes
from Dr to Down) or progresses  to  a  terminal
state  (i.e.,  Point-to-Point, DR Other, Dr, or
Backup).

An ospfIfStateChange trap signifies that there
has  been a change in the state of an OSPF vir-
tual interface.
This trap should be generated when  the  inter-
face  state  regresses  (e.g., goes from Point-
to-Point to Down) or progresses to  a  terminal
state (i.e., Point-to-Point).

SDESC
An  ospfNbrStateChange  trap  signifies   that
there  has been a change in the state of a non-
virtual OSPF neighbor.   This  trap  should  be
generated  when  the  neighbor  state regresses
(e.g., goes from Attempt or Full  to  1-Way  or
Down)  or progresses to a terminal state (e.g.,
2-Way or Full).  When an  neighbor  transitions
from  or  to Full on non-broadcast multi-access
and broadcast networks, the trap should be gen-
erated  by the designated router.  A designated
router transitioning to Down will be  noted  by
ospfIfStateChange.

An ospfIfConfigError  trap  signifies  that  a
packet  has  been received on a non-virtual in-
terface  from  a  router  whose   configuration
parameters  conflict  with this router's confi-
guration parameters.  Note that the  event  op-

An ospfTxRetransmit  trap  signifies  than  an
OSPF  packet  has  been retransmitted on a non-

SDESC
An ospfOriginateLsa trap signifies that a  new
LSA  has  been originated by this router.  This
trap should not be invoked for simple refreshes
of  LSAs  (which happesn every 30 minutes), but
instead will only be invoked  when  an  LSA  is
(re)originated due to a topology change.  Addi-
tionally, this trap does not include LSAs  that
are  being  flushed  because  they have reached
MaxAge.
