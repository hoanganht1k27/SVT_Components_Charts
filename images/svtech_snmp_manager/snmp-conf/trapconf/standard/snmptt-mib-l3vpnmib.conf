This notification is generated when:
a. The ifOperStatus of an interface associated with a VRF 
changes to the up(1) state.
b. When an interface with ifOperStatus = up(1) is 
associated with a VRF.

This notification is generated when:
a. The ifOperStatus of an interface associated with a VRF 
changes to the down(1) state.
b. When an interface with ifOperStatus = up(1) state is 
disassociated with a VRF.

SDESC
This notification is generated when the number of routes
contained by the specified VRF exceeds the value indicated by
mplsVrfMidRouteThreshold. A single notification MUST be generated
when this threshold is exceeded, and no other notifications of
this type should be issued until the value of 
mplsVpnVrfPerfCurrNumRoutes has fallen below that of 
mplsVpnVrfConfMidRouteThreshold.

  1: mplsVpnVrfPerfCurrNumRoutes

EXEC /bin/sh /etc/snmptt/external_command/process_check_result $aA jnx_snmptrap '$Fz' '2' >> /var/log/snmptt/snmptt_exec.log 2>&1
SDESC
This notification is generated when the number of routes
contained by the specified VRF reaches or attempts to exceed
the maximum allowed value as indicated by
mplsVrfMaxRouteThreshold. In cases where 
mplsVpnVrfConfHighRouteThreshold is set to the same value 
as mplsVpnVrfConfMaxRoutes, mplsVpnVrfConfHighRouteThreshold
need not be exceeded; rather, just reached for this notification
to be issued.
Note that mplsVpnVrfConfRouteMaxThreshTime denotes the interval at 
which the this notification will be re-issued after the maximum value 
has been exceeded (or reached if mplsVpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and 
mplsVpnVrfConfHighRouteThreshold are equal) and the initial
notification has been issued. This value is intended to prevent continuous 
generation of notifications by an agent in the event that routes are 
continually added to a VRF after it has reached its maximum value. The 
default value is 10 minutes. If this value is set to 0, the agent should 
only issue a single notification at the time that the maximum threshold has
been reached, and should not issue any more notifications until the value
of routes has fallen below the configured threshold value.
Variables:
  1: mplsVpnVrfPerfCurrNumRoutes
  2: mplsVpnVrfConfHighRouteThreshold

EXEC /bin/sh /etc/snmptt/external_command/process_check_result $aA jnx_snmptrap '$Fz' '2' >> /var/log/snmptt/snmptt_exec.log 2>&1
SDESC
This notification is generated when the number of illegal
label violations on a VRF as indicated by 
mplsVpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns has exceeded 
mplsVpnVrfSecIllegalLblRcvThrsh. The threshold is not 
included in the varbind here because the value of 
mplsVpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns should be one greater than 
the threshold at the time this notification is issued.
Variables:
  1: mplsVpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns
