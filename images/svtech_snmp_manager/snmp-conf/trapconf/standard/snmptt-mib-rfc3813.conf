EVENT mplsXCUp .1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated when the $*

This notification is generated when the
mplsXCOperStatus object for one or more contiguous
entries in mplsXCTable are about to enter the up(1)
state from some other state. The included values of
mplsXCOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this
new state (i.e: up(1)).  The two instances of
mplsXCOperStatus in this notification indicate the range
of indexes that are affected.  Note that all the indexes
of the two ends of the range can be derived from the
instance identifiers of these two objects.  For
cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects
have transitioned into the up(1) state at roughly
the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single
notification for each range of contiguous indexes in
an effort to minimize the emission of a large number
of notifications.  If a notification has to be
issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then
the instance identifier (and values) of the two
mplsXCOperStatus objects MUST be the identical.
Variables:
  1: mplsXCOperStatus
  2: mplsXCOperStatus

This notification is generated when the
mplsXCOperStatus object for one or more contiguous
entries in mplsXCTable are about to enter the

down(2) state.  The two instances of mplsXCOperStatus
in this notification indicate the range of indexes
that are affected.  Note that all the indexes of the
