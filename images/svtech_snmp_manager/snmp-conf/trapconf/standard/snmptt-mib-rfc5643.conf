An ospfv3VirtIfStateChange notification signifies that
there has been a change in the state of an OSPFv3 virtual
interface.
This notification should be generated when the interface
state regresses (e.g., goes from Point-to-Point to Down)
or progresses to a terminal state (i.e., Point-to-Point).

SDESC
An ospfv3NbrStateChange notification signifies that
there has been a change in the state of a
non-virtual OSPFv3 neighbor.  This notification should be
generated when the neighbor state regresses
(e.g., goes from Attempt or Full to 1-Way or
Down) or progresses to a terminal state (e.g.,
2-Way or Full).  When a neighbor transitions
from or to Full on non-broadcast multi-access
and broadcast networks, the notification should be
generated by the Designated Router.  A Designated
Router transitioning to Down will be noted by
ospfIfStateChange.

An ospfv3IfConfigError notification signifies that a
packet has been received on a non-virtual
interface from a router whose configuration
parameters conflict with this router's
configuration parameters.  Note that the event
optionMismatch should cause a notification only if it
prevents an adjacency from forming.
