This notification is generated when:
a. No interface is associated with this VRF, and the first
(and only first) interface associated with it has its
ifOperStatus change to up(1).
b. One interface is associated with this VRF, and
the ifOperStatus of this interface changes to up(1).
c. Multiple interfaces are associated with this VRF, and the
ifOperStatus of all interfaces is down(2), and the first
of those interfaces has its ifOperStatus change to up(1).

This notification is generated when:
a. One interface is associated with this VRF, and
the ifOperStatus of this interface changes from up(1)
to down(2).
b. Multiple interfaces are associated with this VRF, and
the ifOperStatus of all except one of these interfaces is
equal to up(1), and the ifOperStatus of that interface
changes from up(1) to down(2).
c. The last interface with ifOperStatus equal to up(1)
is disassociated from a VRF.

SDESC
This notification is generated when the number of routes
contained by the specified VRF exceeds the value indicated by
mplsL3VpnVrfMidRouteThreshold.  A single notification MUST be
generated when this threshold is exceeded, and no other
notifications of this type should be issued until the value
of mplsL3VpnVrfPerfCurrNumRoutes has fallen below that of
mplsL3VpnVrfConfMidRteThresh.

EVENT mplsL3VpnVrfNumVrfRouteMaxThreshExceeded .1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.11.0.4 "Status Events" Normal

EXEC /bin/sh /etc/snmptt/external_command/process_check_result $aA jnx_snmptrap '$Fz' '2' >> /var/log/snmptt/snmptt_exec.log 2>&1
SDESC
This notification is generated when the number of routes
contained by the specified VRF exceeds or attempts to exceed
the maximum allowed value as indicated by
mplsL3VpnVrfMaxRouteThreshold.  In cases where
mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh is set to the same value
as mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes, mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh
need not be exceeded; rather, just reached for this notification
to be issued.
Note that mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime denotes the interval
at which the this notification will be reissued after the
maximum value has been exceeded (or reached if
mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are
equal) and the initial notification has been issued.  This value
is intended to prevent continuous generation of notifications by
an agent in the event that routes are continually added to a VRF
after it has reached its maximum value.  The default value is 0
minutes.  If this value is set to 0, the agent should only issue
a single notification at the time that the maximum threshold has
been reached, and should not issue any more notifications until
the value of routes has fallen below the configured threshold
value.

EXEC /bin/sh /etc/snmptt/external_command/process_check_result $aA jnx_snmptrap '$Fz' '2' >> /var/log/snmptt/snmptt_exec.log 2>&1
SDESC
This notification is generated when the number of illegal
label violations on a VRF as indicated by
mplsL3VpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns has exceeded
mplsL3VpnIllLblRcvThrsh.  The threshold is not
included in the varbind here because the value of
mplsL3VpnVrfSecIllegalLblVltns should be one greater than
the threshold at the time this notification is issued.

EVENT mplsL3VpnNumVrfRouteMaxThreshCleared .1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.11.0.6 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated only after the number of routes $*
EXEC /bin/sh /etc/snmptt/external_command/process_check_result $aA jnx_snmptrap '$Fz' '2' >> /var/log/snmptt/snmptt_exec.log 2>&1
SDESC
This notification is generated only after the number of routes
contained by the specified VRF exceeds or attempts to exceed
the maximum allowed value as indicated by
mplsVrfMaxRouteThreshold, and then falls below this value.  The
emission of this notification informs the operator that the
error condition has been cleared without the operator having to
query the device.
Note that mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime denotes the interval at
which the mplsNumVrfRouteMaxThreshExceeded notification will
be reissued after the maximum value has been exceeded (or
reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and
mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial
notification has been issued.  Therefore,
the generation of this notification should also be emitted with
this same frequency (assuming that the error condition is
cleared).  Specifically, if the error condition is reached and
cleared several times during the period of time specified in
mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime, only a single notification will
be issued to indicate the first instance of the error condition
as well as the first time the error condition is cleared.
This behavior is intended to prevent continuous generation of
notifications by an agent in the event that routes are
continually added and removed to/from a VRF after it has
reached its maximum value.  The default value is 0.  If this
value is set to 0, the agent should issue a notification
whenever the maximum threshold has been cleared.
