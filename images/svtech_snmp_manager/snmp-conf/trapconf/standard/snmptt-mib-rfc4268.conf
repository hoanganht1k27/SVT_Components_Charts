An entStateOperEnabled notification signifies that the
SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that
the entStateOper object for one of its entities has
transitioned into the 'enabled' state.
The entity this notification refers can be identified by
extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the
variable bindings.  The entStateAdmin and entStateAlarm
varbinds may be examined to find out additional
information on the administrative state at the time of
the operation state change as well as to find out whether
there were any known alarms against the entity at that
time that may explain why the physical entity has become
operationally disabled.
Variables:
  1: entStateAdmin
  2: entStateAlarm
