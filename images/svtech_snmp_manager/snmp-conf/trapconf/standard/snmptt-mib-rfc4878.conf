FORMAT A dot3OamThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or $*

A dot3OamThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or
remote threshold crossing event is detected.  A local
threshold crossing event is detected by the local entity,
while a remote threshold crossing event is detected by the
reception of an Ethernet OAM Event Notification OAMPDU
that indicates a threshold event.
This notification should not be sent more than once per
second.
The OAM entity can be derived from extracting the ifIndex from
the variable bindings.  The objects in the notification
correspond to the values in a row instance in the
dot3OamEventLogTable.
The management entity should periodically check
dot3OamEventLogTable to detect any missed events.

A dot3OamNonThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local
or remote non-threshold crossing event is detected.  A local

event.
This notification should not be sent more than once per
