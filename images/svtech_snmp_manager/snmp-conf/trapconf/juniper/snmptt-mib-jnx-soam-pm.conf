An jnxSoamLmSessionStartStopAlarm notification is sent when the state of
jnxSoamLmCfgSessionStatus changes.
The management entity that receives the notification can identify
the system from the network source address of the notification,
and can identify the individual PM session reporting the start/stop
by the indices in the OID jnxSoamLmCfgSessionStatus, including
dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier, and
jnxSoamLmCfgIndex.
An agent is not to generate more than one jnxSoamLmSessionStartStopAlarm
'notification-event' in a given time interval per LM session as specified
by the jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval. A 'notification-event' is
the transmission of a single notification to a list of notification
destinations.
If additional operational state changes occur within the
jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval period, then notification
generation for these changes are be suppressed by the agent until
the current alarm interval expires. At the end of an alarm interval
period, one notification-event is generated if any operational
state changes occurred since the start of the alarm interval period. In
such a case, another alarm interval period is started right away.

SDESC
An jnxSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm notification is sent if the
following conditions are met for a particular type.
For an aboveAlarm five conditions need to be met:
a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via jnxSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
for a LM crossing or jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing;
and
b) the parameter threshold is configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and
c) the threshold crossing type of bPmThresholdAboveAlarm is enabled;
and
d) the measured value of the parameter exceeds the value configured in
the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for a LM crossing entry or
jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing entry for a type of
bPmThresholdAboveAlarm; and
e) no previous jnxSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm notifications with type
aboveAlarm have been sent relating to the same threshold in the
jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable and the
same parameter, during this Measurement Interval.
For a setAlarm five conditions need to be met:
a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via jnxSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
for a LM crossing or jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing;
and
b) the parameter threshold is configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and
c) the threshold crossing type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm is enabled;
and
d) the measured value of the parameter exceeds the value configured in
the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for a LM crossing entry or
jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing entry for a type of
bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm for the Measurement Interval; and
e) the previous measured value did not
exceed the value configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for
a LM crossing entry or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing
entry for a type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm.
For a clearAlarm five conditions need to be met:
a) measurement of the parameter is enabled via jnxSoamLmCfgMeasurementEnable
for a LM crossing or jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable for a DM crossing;
and
b) the parameter threshold is configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable
or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable; and
c) the threshold crossing type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm is enabled;
and
d) the measured value of the parameter did not exceed the value configured
in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for a LM crossing entry or
jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing entry for a type of
bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm for the Measurement Interval; and
e) the previous measured value did
exceed the value configured in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgTable for
a LM crossing entry or jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgTable for a DM crossing
entry for a type of bPmThresholdSetClearAlarm.
In the case of thresholds applied to a maximum or average measurement
counter, the previous measured value is the value of the counter at the
end of the preceding Measurement Interval. In the case of thresholds
applied to the last measured value, it is the previous measured value.
The management entity that receives the notification can identify
the system from the network source address of the notification,
and can identify the LM or DM session reporting the threshold
crossing by the indices in the jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgThresholdId object,
including dot1agCfmMdIndex, dot1agCfmMaIndex, dot1agCfmMepIdentifier,
and the jnxSoamLmCfgIndex or jnxSoamDmCfgIndex.
An agent is not to generate more than one jnxSoamLmThresholdCrossingAlarm
'notification-event' of a given type per LM or DM session as specified
by jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval. A 'notification-event' is the
transmission of a single notification to a list of notification
destinations.
If additional threshold crossing events occur within the
jnxSoamPmNotificationCfgAlarmInterval period, then notification
generation for these changes are suppressed by the agent until
the current alarm interval expires. At the end of an alarm interval
period, one notification-event is generated if any threshold
crossing events occurred since the start of the alarm interval period.
In such a case, another alarm interval period is started right away.

SDESC
 The jnxSoamPmThresholdFlapAlarm is sent when the CFM Threshold Flap 
Notification feature is enabled which would dampen the 
jnxSoamPmThresholdCrossingAlarm sent to NMS. The jnxSoamPmThresholdFlapAlarm
gives details about Flaps occured during the time interval. The 
jnxSoamPmThresholdFlapAlarm is sent for the follwing below conditions
a) Trap is sent if  one flap sequence has occured
b) Trap is sent if threshold or timer changes happens.
c) Trap is sent when finite iterations counts expires.
